INTRODUCTION
[
1
]
Rise Cannabis Mill Bay Ltd. (the “Licensee”) holds Cannabis Retail Store
licence no. 450552 (the “Licence") pursuant to which it operates the
establishment called Rise Cannabis Mill Bay, located at Unit 104-2734 Barry
Road, Mill Bay, British Columbia (the “Establishment”).
[
2
]
According to the terms of the Licence, the Licensee may sell packaged
cannabis products from 9:00 am to 11:00 pm on all days of the week, subject to
further restriction by the local government or Indigenous Nations.
[
3
]
The Licence is subject, as are all cannabis retail store licences issued
in the province, to the terms and conditions contained in the current edition
of the publication "Cannabis Retail Store Handbook" (the “Terms and
Conditions Handbook”).
ALLEGED
CONTRAVENTION AND PROPOSED PENALTY
[
4
]
The Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch's (the "Branch")
allegations and proposed penalty are set out in the Notice of Enforcement
Action dated February 15, 2024 (the “NOEA") (Exhibit 1, tab 1).
[
5
]
The Branch alleges that, on February 6, 2024, the Licensee contravened
section 69(1)
of the
Cannabis Control and Licensing Act
, SBC 2018, c. 29
(the “
Act
”) by selling cannabis to a minor.
[
6
]
Item 7 of the table in Schedule 2 of the
Cannabis Licensing
Regulation
, B.C. Reg.202/2018 (the “
Regulation
”) sets out the range
of penalties for a first contravention of this type within a 12-month period as
being a monetary penalty of $7,000 to $11,000 or a period of suspension of the
Licence of 7 to 11 days.  This allegation, if proven, would be a first contravention
by the Licensee within a 12-month period and the Branch seeks either a monetary
penalty of $7,000 or a seven-day suspension of the Licence.
[
7
]
The Licensee admits that the contravention alleged in the NOEA occurred
but submits it has been duly diligent in complying with the provisions of the
Act
,
the
Regulation
,
and the Licence so that the defence of due diligence
applies and it is not liable for the contravention.  The Licensee indicated
that if it is found to be liable for the contravention a monetary penalty is
the preferred penalty.
[

]
The Licensee and the Branch agreed to the hearing being conducted
on-line, using Microsoft Teams.
[
9
]
For the purposes of this hearing and in accordance with
section 8
of the
Act
, the general manager of the Branch has delegated to me the powers, duties,
and functions of the general manager under
section 38
of the
Act.

EVIDENCE
The Branch
[
10
]
The Branch advocate called two Branch inspectors as witnesses.
Inspector A
[
11
]
Inspector A has been an inspector with the Branch for six years and was
appointed Branch investigator six months ago.  He has authority to conduct
liquor and cannabis inspections throughout the province and has conducted
between 1,500 and 2,000 inspections.  Of those, between 100 to 200 have been
cannabis inspections.
[
12
]
Inspector A reviewed the Minors as Agents Program (the “MAP”) whereby
the Branch is legislatively authorized to hire, train, and employ youths under
19 years of age to enter licensed premises and attempt to buy cannabis or
liquor, as the case may be, under the supervision of Branch inspectors.  The
objective of the MAP is to ensure that licensees are properly ensuring that
sales of liquor or cannabis products are not made to persons under the legal
age of 19 years.  The minor agents are trained to dress and act normally and
are also provided with some information on cannabis products, so they know how
to request an item for purchase.  While conducting inspections, the inspectors
keep the minor agent’s identification so that if identification is requested,
the minor agent can answer truthfully that they do not have any with them.
[
13
]
Inspector A testified that on February 6, 2024, Inspector A and a second
inspector (“Inspector B”) and Minor Agent #166 conducted a series of MAP
inspections.  Minor Agent’s age, being under 19 years, was confirmed by his government-issued
identification, which the Inspectors photocopied and held during the
inspections.
[
14
]
The Establishment was one of the premises inspected.  Inspector A described
entering the Establishment, followed shortly thereafter by the Minor Agent, and
how he had a clear line of sight and observed the Minor Agent purchasing
cannabis products and leaving the Establishment, all without being asked for
identification.
[
15
]
Inspector A identified the Notice of Enforcement Action (“the NOEA”) (Exhibit
1, tab 1), issued to the Licensee and confirmed that it accurately reflected
what occurred during the February 6, 2024 inspection of the Establishment.  He
confirmed the NOEA was sent to the Licensee by email.
[
16
]
Inspector A also testified that the Licensee was subject to the Terms
and Conditions Handbook (Exhibit 1, tab 4) which prohibits sales of cannabis
products to minors and that the Licensee should be aware of that prohibition.
[
17
]
Inspector A also identified the documents submitted as Exhibit 1, tabs 5
to 10, being the official floor plan, his inspection notes, a photograph of the
items sold to the minor, the receipt from the cannabis purchase, the Licensee’s
staff members’ SIR certificates and Minor Agent #166’s photographs and
identification (both redacted) and his Observations and Statement Form.
[
18
]
In addition, Inspector A testified that selling cannabis products to
persons who are under the age of 19 years can cause detrimental effects on a
young person’s development and also can cause negative health impacts.
[
19
]
Inspector A advised that the Licensee has a clear compliance history and
for that reason this would be a first contravention.  In the circumstances, the
Branch recommends a penalty of $7,000 or 7-day licence suspension.
[
20
]
Inspector A confirmed the Establishment only opened in August 2023 and
believed it would have been subject to a routine administrative inspection at
30 days and six months, with nothing reported from those inspections as being
unsatisfactory.
Inspector B
[
21
]
Inspector B has been an inspector with the Branch since March 2021, and was
appointed as a senior inspector six months ago.  She conducts liquor and
cannabis inspections, including both administrative inspections for things like
proper documentation and record keeping and public safety inspections for things
like overservice, overcrowding and sales to minors.  She has conducted over 1,000
inspections, including about 200 inspections of cannabis retail stores.
[
22
]
In her testimony, Inspector B described the purpose and processes of the
MAP, the contents of the NOEA, and the inspection of the Establishment on February
6, 2024.  Inspector B also testified that she obtained copies of the Selling It
Right (“SIR”) Certificates of the Licensee’s employee who sold the cannabis products
to the Minor Agent and of the store manager, who Inspector B spoke to on the
phone.
[
23
]
She confirmed the Licensee’s compliance history showed as clear and, if
there were any other contraventions, they should have shown up.  She also
confirmed the Branch is seeking the minimum penalty as this is a first
contravention of this type.
The Licensee
[
24
]
The Licensee’s representative, being its Director of Operations, gave
evidence and also called two witnesses to give evidence: the store manager, and
an employee.
The Director of Operations
[
25
]
The Director of Operations (the “Director”) admitted that an employee
sold cannabis products to the Minor Agent without asking for identification,
which was a contravention of the
Act
and the Terms and Conditions of the
Licence.  However, the Licensee was claiming the defence of due diligence.
[
26
]
The Director testified that the Licensee (or related corporate entities)
has a number of liquor and cannabis licences, including two liquor retail
stores, three cannabis retail stores, a brewpub, and a manufacturing licence.  A
general manager oversees all of the Licensee’s licensed premises, with each of
the Licensee’s premises having its own store manager.  Several of these
premises have been in operation for a number of years, with this Establishment
being the newest as it opened in August 2023.
[
27
]
The Director is responsible for the development of the Licensee’s
policies and procedures for all of the Licensee’s premises.  The Director and
the applicable store manager, and sometimes the general manager, are involved
in hiring and the training of new employees.  He testified that the Licensee
takes its responsibilities for hiring and training very seriously and invests
up-front in training new employees.
[
28
]
He said that the first step in hiring is always to ensure a new employee
has their SIR certificate.  After an initial screening and a telephone
interview, typically the Director, or occasionally the general manager, will
interview the prospective employee in person.  A meeting with the store manager
may follow and reference checks are made.
[
29
]
The Director then referred to the Licensee’s training manual (Exhibit 3)
(the “training manual”), which sets out the Licensee’s core values and policies
and is used across the Licensee’s licensed premises and is updated every year
if needed.  For example, he said that it was recently updated to address
personal relationships between employees.  A copy of the training manual is
given to new employees to read in advance of their first day, plus electronic
copies of the training manual and the Terms and Conditions Handbook are always
available on-line to all employees, who are encouraged to review those
documents.
[
30
]
The Director said the Licensee’s policy on identification is to request
identification from anyone who enters the store and looks to be under the age of
30 and, if unsure, to always ask for ID.  He also said that the Licensee’s
policy goes beyond simply requesting identification from persons looking to
purchase cannabis products and addresses the prohibition on allowing anyone in
the premises who is under the age of 19 years, including babies in arms.  The
policy also provides that if a group comes in, everyone in the group must have
two pieces of valid identification and if even just one of them does not, then
no one in the group can be sold cannabis products.  And if it looks like a
potential purchaser might be buying cannabis products for someone waiting
outside who may be under the legal age, no cannabis products can be sold to
that person.  For this reason, employees are given training in how to deal with
persons who may become aggressive if refused service.
[
31
]
Page 3 of the training manual sets out those policies, as follows:
Identification
Policy: Our establishment
will not serve cannabis or cannabis related products to any customer who is
under the age of 19.
You must ask any person who
appears to be under the age of 30, for two pieces of ID upon entering the
store. The first piece, issued by a government agency, should include the
person’s name, signature, birth date and picture (BC Services Card, driver’s
license, passport). The second piece must include an imprint of the person’s
name plus their signature and/or picture (credit card, bank card, CareCard). If
they do not have both pieces they do not get served.
No exceptions
. If
two people or a group come into the store, every person must have a two pieces
of valid ID. If all patrons do not have sufficient ID, they must all leave the
store. This includes anyone in the group who has both pieces of ID. Due to the
fact that they came into the store as a group, makes it illegal to sell to
them. The reason for this is that it is presumed that they will be consuming
the cannabis together.
There are no persons under the age of 19 permitted in
the Cannabis store at any time.
This also applies even if a person
would like to buy a non-Cannabis related product. A $750 fine can also be given
by a Cannabis Inspector to an individual staff member who is found not asking
for ID. In addition, if the Cannabis Store is found negligent and has not asked
for ID, we will receive an immediate $10,000 fine.
There is a zero-tolerance
policy on this issue.
Minors
Policy: Our establishment will not serve Cannabis to
minors or to any customer who is contributing to serving a minor.
If you have reason to believe a customer is purchasing
Cannabis or other Cannabis related items from the Cannabis store for a minor,
you must deny the sale. For example, if you see the customer has people waiting
outside of the store for them, whether in a car or in the parking lot, ask the
customer to have those people come in to show their ID as well. If they are
unable to provide identification, you must deny the sale. If a customer
verbalizes that they are purchasing cannabis or accessories for a minor, you
must deny the sale. If you see a person who may be a minor outside the store
asking people to make a purchase for them, you must deny the sale to whomever
attempts to make the purchase.
[
32
]
The Director of Operations said employees are told to use their
discretion in assessing if a person is under 30 and if in any doubt, to ask for
identification.  Some direction is given in how to assess the person’s age –
for example, not to simply rely on having a beard.  Employees are told that if
they do not ask for identification when they should have, they will be
terminated.
[
33
]
He testified that new employees are required to sign off that they have
read and understand the contents of the training manual.  He said an employee
is asked if they have any questions before signing off.  He then identified the
copy of the sign off by the employee who sold the Minor Agent the cannabis products
(Exhibit 4).
[
34
]
He also identified the employee quiz included at the end of the training
manual that employees must complete and pass.  That short quiz asks about the
circumstances when the employee is responsible to ask a customer for
identification (but instead of the age of 30, it refers to the age of 25
years), to identify the required number and acceptable types of identification,
the signs of mental intoxication, and the signs of physical intoxication.
[
35
]
The Director acknowledged the quiz referred to 25 years as the age, and
not 30 years, but said this was inadvertently not updated when the policy, as
earlier set out in the manual, was changed from 25 to 30 years.  He noted the
questions on the quiz were all related to issues of zero tolerance, like the
need to ask for identification.
[
36
]
The Director reviewed the four days of one-on-one employee training.  He
said that day 1 starts with either the Director or the store manager meeting
with the new employee to go over the Licensee’s training manual, including the core
values and the policies on identification and sales to minors, and various
other documents.  On day 2, the new employee will shadow a senior employee who
is expected to model how to meet and interact with customers, how to request
and review identification, and how to decline service for no identification.  On
day 3, the new employee will operate the cash register while being shadowed by
a senior employee who oversees the new employee to ensure the new employee is
following the Licensee’s policies, including requesting identification.  On day
4, the new employee continues to be shadowed by a more senior employee and will
also review the training manual again.  Days 2, 3 and 4 are each eight hour
shifts.  Different senior staff may be involved in the shadowing experiences of
a new employee but all of those staff will have at least three months’ experience. 
The Director testified there is no question that the need to ask for and how to
review identification will have arisen multiple times during the shadowing
periods.  To review the identification, employees are taught to either take it
in hand or have it placed on the counter, and they are taught what constitutes
acceptable first and second pieces.
[
37
]
The Director referred to the new employee training checklist (Exhibit 7)
which both the new trainee and the supervising trainer are expected to
complete.  He acknowledged that the Licensee’s policies on checking for identification,
what is acceptable identification, prohibiting sales to minors, and to make
entries in the incident log are not listed on that checklist.
[
38
]
The employees who started working at the Establishment on its opening in
August, 2023 were trained in advance at the Licensee’s cannabis retail store in
Colwood.  The employee who sold the cannabis to the Minor Agent was one of
those employees.
[
39
]
The Director said that, after the employee’s training is completed, the
store manager is to conduct 30 and 90-day check-ins with the employee.  The 30-day
check-in is comprised of asking for and giving feedback.  The 90-day check-in
is more formal and may address if more training is needed.
[
40
]
Annual one-on-one reviews are also held with each employee and, after the
review is completed, the employees are to sign off again that they have read
and understand the contents of the training manual.  No new or additional
quizzes are given at that time. As this Establishment is less than a year old,
no annual reviews of its employees have been held yet, so no sign offs were
available to submit as evidence.
[
41
]
The dates for the 30 and 90-day check-ins and the annual reviews are
entered into the Slack application (described below) to remind the store
managers to undertake these tasks.
[
42
]
In addition, the Director holds quarterly meetings with the store
managers and they in turn hold quarterly conversations with staff.  These one-on-one
conversations are to discuss any issues the store manager or the employees might
have, with employees typically to be reminded to ask for identification if
under 30 and if unsure, to always ask.
[
43
]
He also testified that the Licensee holds annual staff meetings for each
of its licensed establishments that last about two hours, and all staff from that
establishment are expected to and are paid to attend.  Meeting agendas and
minutes are not made but the topics covered typically include information about
the MAP and the need to request identification.  The employees are required to
sign that they have attended the meeting.  If an employee cannot attend, the
store manager is to meet with that employee and go over the items covered with
the employee.  This Establishment is less than a year old, so no annual meeting
has been held yet, so no sign off about attending was available to review.
[
44
]
The Director described the Branch “stoplight” sticker on the legal age
to purchase cannabis and the Licensee’s own sticker reminder to staff, both
located at the cash register (Exhibit 5).  He also identified a screen shot of
the Point of Sale home screen that shows the current date of birth for the age
at which it is legal to buy cannabis, which automatically changes daily and is
intended to be a reference tool for the employees (Exhibit 6).
[
45
]
The Director also identified the photograph showing a 19 plus sticker on
the outside of the entry door (Exhibit 8), a free-standing greeting sign
advising customers to have their two pieces of identification ready (Exhibit
10), and signs posted in the staffroom reminding staff of the legal
requirements and what constitutes valid identification (Exhibits 9 and 11).  In
addition, the Director said, two Branch issued posters are posted next to the
Licence and floor plan.
[
46
]
The Director testified the Licensee uses an application called “Slack”
as a means to communicate with its employees and the employees’ channel on the
application doubles as an incident log.  All employees can post to that shared
channel and discuss and interact with each other about any issues.  In
addition, a hard copy incident binder is available for staff to post and review
entries and photographs of problematic customers who may have been banned.
[
47
]
The Establishment typically has seven or eight staff persons with two
persons on shift at all times, with the shifts being 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., and 1
p.m. to 9 p.m.  On February 6, 2024, when the inspection was made, two
employees were on duty.  The employee who sold the cannabis products to the
Minor Agent was terminated for making the sale contrary to the Licensee’s policies
and for which she had been warned there was zero tolerance.
[
48
]
Employees are told about the dangers of selling cannabis products to
minors by cautioning them about “the duty of care” owed to the minor and to the
public, but that caution does not include the public health impacts on minors.
[
49
]
No secret shopper program is in place but friends of the Director may comment
on the customer service and a friend who appears to be under 30 will report if
she was asked for identification.
The Store Manager
[
50
]
The Store Manager began working for the Licensee in March 2022 in one of
its liquor retail stores.  She was subsequently promoted to store manager and
became the store manager of this Establishment when it opened in August 2023.
[
51
]
The Store Manager said that new hires are required to have their SIR
certificates before starting work.  The training program was initially only
three days but was later expanded to four days.  During that time, the new
employee would learn how to ask for identification and how to refuse to sell products
to someone without identification.  Staff are expected to be polite but direct,
and to explain that they have no flexibility to sell any product without
identification.
[
52
]
The Store Manager confirmed the initial training for this Establishment
was undertaken at the Licensee’s Colwood retail cannabis store where lots of
experienced staff were available to provide the training.  She testified that
the Colwood training was followed up with various role-playing scenarios
conducted at the Establishment before it opened to the public, to reinforce
what needed to be done and to practise how to do it.  Those scenarios included
how to ask for identification, the acceptable identification, how to deal with
a group by asking them all for identification, how to refuse to sell any
products for lack of identification, and how to ask a more senior staff person
for help.  Employees are also taught what is acceptable identification and
that, for example, producing identification on a mobile phone is not
acceptable.
[
53
]
After the Establishment opened, the new staff members were shadowed for
the first week by the Store Manager and another experienced staff member.  This
was in addition to the usual training, to make sure they were “good to go”.  This
included the staff member who sold the cannabis products to the Minor Agent.
[
54
]
The training manual sign-off and quizzes and the staff training
checklists were all done at Colwood as part of the training at that location
and so were kept there.  The Store Manager relied on that having been done and
did not request or review those documents for the employees trained at that
location.
[
55
]
A copy of the training manual is kept in a binder at the Establishment
and is available for staff to re-read.
[
56
]
She said she tells staff to ask for identification if the person looks
to be under 40 and she reminds them that no one under 19 years old is allowed to
be in the store, even babies.  And if a person does not have identification,
even regulars whose identification has been checked before, they must be
refused service.  Plus, if one person in a group does not have identification
then no one in the group can purchase any cannabis products and the whole group
is to leave the premises.
[
57
]
In directing staff in how to assess age, she will use things like if a
person looks youthful, their size and stature, how the person is acting and how
they are dressed, but not to simply rely on how the person is dressed, and if
they are in a group, to consider how the group is acting.  She testified that she
always tells staff if in any doubt to ask for identification.
[
58
]
Staff members are told to look at the picture on the identification and
make sure it matches the person presenting it.  She did not believe the staff
members were trained to ask questions to verify if the identification belonged
to the person presenting it.
[
59
]
The Store Manager said she always encourages staff to become familiar
with what is acceptable identification and to learn about the variations in
identification requirements in other provinces.  The staff were told about the
MAP and that they could be under scrutiny.  The Store Manager also told staff
about other things Branch inspectors might be looking for, like drawers left
open.
[
60
]
She testified that if she or another staff person sees another staff
person not asking for identification when they should, they will intervene and
ask if they have asked for identification.
[
61
]
She testified the 30 and 90-day check-ins and the quarterly reviews held
with employees are intended to identify any issues or problems the employee
might have.  These are one-on-one private conversations held in the staff room.
 No new or additional quizzes are used to test the employee’s knowledge at that
time.
[
62
]
The Store Manager said that staff meetings are not held as the numbers are
small and the employees’ work schedules vary.  The Slack application is used to
keep employees informed about problematic customers and other matters like the
unacceptable sale to the Minor Agent on February 6.  If a matter is important,
she asks employees to use a checkmark to indicate that they have read the
message.
[
63
]
The Slack application is also used as a form of incident log, with a
paper incident book also kept for more serious matters.  The paper log may have
photos of problem customers and is kept in the staff room, but there is no
requirement for staff to actually look at it.
[
64
]
She said all the staff knew the employee who sold the cannabis products
to the Minor Agent had been terminated for doing that.
[
65
]
She testified that including the birth date for legal purchase on the
POS screen is intended to make it easy for staff, so they do not have to do any
calculations to make that determination.
[
66
]
The Store Manager said that with four licensed retail cannabis stores
the Licensee takes its responsibilities seriously and wants to be a good
neighbour and follow all the rules.  They know that sales to minors will do
damage to the minor and will also reflect badly on the stores and damage their
reputation as good citizens.  She tells staff that the Licensee is responsible
for what can happen after a sale to a minor, or to someone who might be
suspected of sharing or selling product with minors.  She said cannabis can
affect younger brains more and early use may cause higher susceptibility to
mental health issues in the future, plus there is a potential for getting into
trouble.
[
67
]
She testified that the Licensee had posted several of the social
responsibility posters provided by the Branch.  The number of posters increased
after the February 6, 2024 incident, with additional posters now up in the staff
room to remind staff, and another free-standing poster telling customers to
have their identification ready.
[
68
]
The Store Manager testified that the employee who had sold the cannabis
to the Minor Agent had been fully trained and was experienced in asking for
identification.  The Store Manager had conducted 30 and 90-day check-ins and
quarterly reviews with the employee and there was no indication the employee
did not fully understand her responsibilities.  It was a shock when she made
the sale without asking for identification.
The Sales Clerk
[
69
]
The Sales Clerk has worked at the Establishment since it opened in
August 2023.  She is not the employee who sold the cannabis product to the
Minor Agent.  She was called to give evidence about the Licensee’s training
program, policies, and protocols.
[
70
]
The Sales Clerk testified that she had her SIR certificate prior to
starting her training.  She and other new staff had four days training at the
Colwood location, followed by additional pre-opening training at the
Establishment.  She said there was lots of in-depth learning and questions were
encouraged.  She said by the time the Establishment opened, she was confident
[in her ability to do her job properly].  She compared that training to
training she had received from other employers and said it was the most formal,
and she felt well supported.
[
71
]
She confirmed she read the training manual when hired, had been given time
to absorb it and once she did that, she signed it, with the trainer making sure
she understood the contents.  This was done as part of training at the Colwood
store.
[
72
]
Her Colwood training included shadowing more senior staff members, who
would check for identification, even of regular customers, and would check in
with her to see if she understood what needed to be done; then they would
shadow her.  She did not see the trainers have to decline sales for no identification
as that did not occur but they taught her how to do it and they practised by
role-playing.  She now declines service for no identification at least three or
four times a week.  She will try to explain why she cannot sell without
identification and tells the customer to come back with it.
[
73
]
The Store Clerk did not recall any subsequent quizzes or tests by the
Licensee and said the reviews were more like the managers checking in with her,
but not like a test.
[
74
]
The trainers also showed her how to do an incident report on Slack, with
the need to do that dependent on how “big” the incident was.  If it was simply
a customer being rude, that probably would not be written up.  If she denied
service, she would record the time, so if necessary, the security cameras could
be reviewed, and the reason why she denied service.
[
75
]
The Sales Person testified the Slack application was used to bring new
things to the attention of staff and as an incident book.  She read all the
messages posted by management and others on Slack, and she understood senior
staff was able to track that she had done that.  She said that if she needed
to, she was comfortable in directly messaging the Store Manager or the Director
of Operations.  According to the Sales Person, the staff were always checking
in with each other and the Store Manager.  After February 6, 2024, the staff
started recording more things in Slack, not just the “big things”.
[
76
]
She also confirmed there is a binder with entries about banned customers
that she goes through and familiarizes herself with.  Plus, the training binder
was easily available to staff for reference and refreshing if in any doubt or
to learn about new rules.
[
77
]
She understood the Establishment’s policy is to always ask for two
pieces of identification from anyone who looked to be under 30 years old, even just
to be in the store.  If she had any inkling the person was not 30, she would
ask for identification but she would not ask people who were obviously senior
citizens.  In assessing age, she would look at hair color, how they carried
themselves, their clothing, for eye contact, and would not assume a person with
a beard, even a salt and pepper one, was of legal age.  She said it is not a
hard and fast rule [on assessing age], and you needed to exercise your best
judgment.  If in doubt, it was easier to simply ask, even if you knew the
person was of age.  On one occasion, she was told to and did ask a good friend
to produce their identification.
[
78
]
She confirmed the signage that was in place, the date of birth on the
POS, and the posters in the staff room.
[
79
]
She anticipated getting a refresher after one year, but that time had
not come yet.  Many of her shifts were alongside the Store Manager so she got
lots of opportunities for feedback.  The only staff meetings were group
discussions on Slack.
[
80
]
The Sales Clerk said the SIR program has a module on “fake ID” with a
test on that part of that program, plus she thought the Licensee’s binder has a
refresher on that.  To test for authenticity, she might call the person by the
name on the ID and see if or how they respond, and she might also ask their
horoscope.  She also mentioned a signature test.
[
81
]
She knew that selling cannabis products to minors could cause problems,
with their brain development possibly being impacted, and may cause minors to
make poor decisions.  She also said the Licensee did not want a bad reputation,
and angry parents complaining.
[
82
]
The Sales Clerk was aware of the MAP but was not aware of any secret
shopper program to test employees.
SUBMISSIONS
The Branch
[
83
]
The Branch advocate says the
evidence and admissions support finding the contravention has been proven.
[
84
]
With respect to the defence
of due diligence, the Branch advocate says the evidence shows the Licensee’s
policies on the age to ask for identification are unclear and confusing with
the ages of 25, 30 and 40 all being used.
[
85
]
The Branch Advocate also
notes that according to the Licensee’s own evidence, several of the signs and
posters and the free-standing sign were only introduced after February 6, 2024,
and the date for establishing due diligence was February 6, 2024.  The same
timing consideration applies to making entries in the incident logbook, plus
the ease of on-going access to Slack as a form of an incident book is
questionable.
[
86
]
Also, the Licensee failed to
provide the signed off checklists for the staff training, which should have
been transferred from the Colwood location to the Mill Bay location.  In any
case, that checklist does not list checking for identification or making
entries in the incident logbook as items to be checked.
[
87
]
The Branch advocate noted
that staff meetings are not held and the dangers of sales to minors is not
followed up post-training.
[
88
]
The POS notation of the date
of birth is helpful, but unless changed up, it can become rote and ignored.  Plus,
samples of various jurisdictions’ identification would be helpful to staff in
assessing those documents for validity.
The Licensee
[
89
]
The Licensee’s representative
submits the Licensee has met the test of due diligence.
[
90
]
He referred to the four days
of training, which included extensive periods of shadowing and the training
checklist, all corroborated by the Store Manager and the Sales Clerk.  The
Licensee follows up the initial training with the 30 and 90-day conversational
reviews and the only reason the annual reviews had not been undertaken for this
location is the Establishment is not a year old yet.
[
91
]
The Licensee’s training
manual and the Terms and Conditions Handbook are both readily available to
staff to review if they want a refresher.
[
92
]
The Licensee’s representative
says the policy is, and always has been, to check for identification if a
person looks to be under 30 years.
[
93
]
The Licensee’s representative
also says a number of the signs and posters were in place on February 6, 2024. 
The signs and posters added after that date were simply meant to supplement the
ones already in place.
[
94
]
The Licensee’s representative
says Slack has been an effective way to communicate with staff, and now it is
almost becoming too detailed in terms of the amount of follow-up.
[
95
]
The Licensee’s representative
noted the Licensee’s clean record at all of its licensed establishments.  The
sales clerk who sold the cannabis products to the Minor Agent was immediately
terminated and the importance of the need to request identification has been
reinforced with the Licensee’s staff.
[
96
]
The Licensee referenced prior
decisions of the General Manager respecting the application of the test of due
diligence to the sale of cannabis to a minor and said that it had met the
standard applied in those decisions.
[
97
]
If a penalty is to be imposed,
the Licensee prefers a $7,000 monetary penalty so staff are not negatively
impacted by being put out of work.
REASONS AND DECISION
Contravention
[
98
]
The Licensee admits the contravention occurred as alleged and I find on
the Branch’s evidence and that admission that the contravention, the sale of
cannabis to a minor contrary to
section 69(1)
of the
Act
,
has been
proven.
Due Diligence
[
99
]
The Licensee is entitled to a defence if it demonstrates it was duly
diligent in taking reasonable steps to prevent the contravention from
occurring.  The Licensee must not only prove it has established procedures to
identify and deal with potential problems, but it must also ensure that those
procedures are consistently acted upon and problems are effectively dealt with.
[
100
]
The leading case on due diligence is
R v. Sault Ste. Marie
(
1979)
2 SCR 1299, where at page 1331,
Dickson, J. sets out the test for due
diligence:
Where an employer
is charged in respect of an act committed by an employee acting in the course
of employment, the question will be whether the act took place without the
accused’s direction or approval, thus negating wilful involvement of the
accused, and whether the accused exercised all reasonable care by establishing
a proper system to prevent commission of the offence and by taking reasonable
steps to ensure the effective operation of the system. The availability of the
defence to a corporation will depend on whether such due diligence was taken by
those who are the directing mind and will of the corporation, whose acts are
therefore in law the acts of the corporation itself.
[
101
]
The BC Supreme Court, in
Beverly Corners Liquor Store Ltd. v. British
Columbia (Liquor Control and Licensing Branch)
,
2012 BCSC 1851
, considered and
clarified the application of the defence of due diligence in the context of the
sale of liquor to a minor contrary to the
Liquor Control and Licensing Act
(see paragraphs 41 to 44).
[
102
]
In accordance with
Beverly Corners
, the defence of due diligence
may be considered in two stages:
Whether the employee who
     committed the contravention was a directing mind of the licensee – if so,
     the defence of due diligence is not available and the inquiry stops
     there.
If the employee who committed the
     contravention was not a directing mind of the licensee, then the questions
     to be considered and answered are whether the licensee had:
implemented adequate training
      and other systems to prevent the contravention;
and,
taken reasonable steps to ensure
      the effective application of that education and the operation of those
      systems.
[
103
]
Both of these issues are factual and will depend on the evidence
presented.
Directing Mind
[
104
]
The directing mind of a corporation is someone who is responsible for
developing and supervising the implementation of corporate policies, including
hiring and training policies and procedures.
[
105
]
I find that the Licensee’s representative and the general manager are
responsible for developing the Licensee’s corporate policies, including hiring
and training policies and procedures and they, with the Store Manager, are
responsible for implementing those policies.  On this basis, I find these
persons to be directing minds of the Licensee.  None of them were present at
the time the cannabis was sold to the Minor Agent.
[
106
]
I further find that the sales clerk who sold the cannabis to the Minor
Agent was not responsible for developing and supervising the implementation of
the Licensee’s corporate or any other policies and is therefore not a directing
mind of the Licensee.
[
107
]
I then need to move to the second stage and assess the adequacy of the
Licensee’s training and systems to prevent the sale of cannabis to minors and
the effective application of that education and systems.
Training and Systems in Place to
Prevent the Sale of Cannabis to Minors
[
108
]
The Court has said the onus is on the licensee to provide the evidence
to establish on a balance of probabilities that it had exercised reasonable
care in establishing adequate training and other systems and ensuring effective
application of them.
[
109
]
The Branch has been consistent in saying the standard to be applied to
the evidence is reasonableness and not perfection, and whether and how the
standard is met will depend on the particular circumstances.  What other
licensees may do in terms of training and systems may be informative as to what
may be reasonable care, especially if the type of licence and the circumstances
are somewhat similar.
[
110
]
As such, in assessing the Licensee’s evidence of its employee training
and systems to determine whether the requirements of the due diligence defence
have been satisfied, I have applied the standard of reasonableness and have
assessed that evidence on a balance of probabilities.
[
111
]
I have considered and assessed all of the Licensee’s evidence on
training and systems in place.  As a preliminary comment, I found all three of
the Licensee’s witnesses to be forthright and reliable and I was especially
impressed with the candour of the Sales Clerk.
Training
[
112
]
In summary, the Licensee requires new employees to have their SIR
certificate as a prerequisite to being hired.  A new employee is then expected
to read the training manual (which includes as first items the policies on
identification and to not sell cannabis to minors), ask any questions they may
have, sign acknowledging that they understand all of the policies, and take a
short test on the identification requirements.  The new employee then receives
three days of intensive training consisting of shadowing, being shadowed and
practising scenarios that might arise, including when a person does not have
identification.  A short checklist of what is covered is completed by the
trainer.
[
113
]
I find the Licensee’s policies on identification and the prohibition on
selling cannabis to minors as set out in the training manual to be adequate,
and their prominence as the first items in the training manual to be a good way
to highlight their importance.  I also find the short quiz, focusing on
identification requirements, to be adequate at this stage of the training.
[
114
]
I find the Licensee’s three eight-hour days of shadow training at a busy
cannabis retail store to be adequate as it provided ample opportunities for a
new employee to learn from the trainer and then to actually request
identification from a customer.  I also find the role-playing of scenarios that
may not have been encountered in that shadow period (ie., the failure to
actually have identification) to be adequate training of that circumstance.
[
115
]
From the oral evidence of the Store Manager and the Sales Clerk, I am also
satisfied that the training, either as part of the shadowing or the subsequent
on-floor supervision, includes how to assess age and how to assess identification
for its validity and whether it belongs to the person presenting it.  However,
I would suggest the Licensee consider specifically adding these important topics
to its training manual, shadowing program and training checklist.
[
116
]
I find the Licensee’s current training checklist to be inadequate in
that it does not include any reference to the need to request identification,
what comprises valid identification or the prohibition on selling to minors. 
This is a gap that needs to be filled.  The training checklist should provide
for both the trainer and the trainee to sign off on having observed each other
in dealing with requesting identification and understanding what comprises
adequate identification, how to refuse sales for no identification, how to
assess age, and how to assess the validity of the identification and that it
belongs to the person presenting it.
[
117
]
While both the Store manager and the Sales Clerk had a good
understanding of the harms to minors from the use of cannabis, another item I
would recommend the Licensee to incorporate into its training manual is the
appreciation and understanding of why the sale of cannabis to minors is
detrimental to the minor and the community, and not simply the impact of such
sales, if identified, on the Licensee and the sales clerk in terms of penalties.
[
118
]
I find that the sale clerk who sold the cannabis products to the Minor
Agent without asking for identification had been adequately trained to request
identification from the Minor Agent, and had, until the contravention, been a
good employee.
[
119
]
Despite the shortcomings I have noted, based on the oral evidence of the
Licensee’s witnesses and the documents submitted as evidence, I find the
Licensee’s training program to prevent the sale of cannabis to minors to be
reasonable and sufficient to meet the test of the due diligence defence.
Systems in Place
[
120
]
In addition to requiring adequate training, the Court has said an
employer needs to put in place adequate systems to ensure that that training is
in fact applied.
[
121
]
In summary, the Store Manager observes and supervises employees on an
on-going basis, prompting them if required.  Thirty and 90-day reviews of new
employees and annual reviews of all employees are required.  The Licensee also has
regular quarterly meetings with the Store Manager that regularly includes
discussion about the need for identification.  The Store Manager then meets
informally with the staff members and reiterates that need.  Annual staff
meetings are to be held and employees are to be paid to attend and will be
required to sign off on attendance.  Slack is used to regularly communicate
with staff.  In addition, a hard copy binder of incidents is also kept and is
available to all staff for review.  The legal date of birth for purchase of
product is noted at the POS system.  Signs are in place to remind both staff
and customers of the need to be of legal age in order to be in the store and to
purchase cannabis products.  The Licensee has a strict policy of no tolerance
for sales to minors.
[
122
]
I find, based on the oral evidence of the Store Manager and the Sales
Clerk, that the Store Manager keeps a good watch over the staff and engages
with them to ensure they are appropriately asking for identification.  The
prompt to the Sales Clerk to ask her friend for identification is a good example
of that.
[
123
]
I find the 30 and 90-day new employee reviews provide a good opportunity
to review with staff their responsibility to check for identification but
should not be limited to questions and answers specific to or raised by that
employee.  I accept that the Store Manager will raise identification
requirements with any staff member who needs reminding, but a printed list of
topics to be covered with every employee, including identification requirements
and the prohibition on serving minors, would be a good way to ensure these
topics are discussed and reinforced with each new employee.
[
124
]
As this Establishment is not yet a year old, annual employee reviews
have not yet been done, but I accept the Director of Operations’ evidence that annual
employee reviews are done in all of its other establishments and will be done
at this Establishment.  A review checklist would be helpful in assessing the
adequacy of the review in reminding staff and ensuring they know their
responsibilities for identification.  In addition, adding quizzes or tests as
part of these reviews may provide a good way to ensure that employees know
their responsibilities.  However, having all employees re-read and re-sign
having read and understood the training manual, as is currently done as part of
an annual review, is a good start to doing that.
[
125
]
The quarterly and annual meetings provide some evidence of having
adequate systems in place, however the Licensee should consider making agendas
and minutes available to staff as an additional prompt about the need to
request proper identification and the prohibition on sales to minors.
[
126
]
The use of Slack can be an effective way to regularly communicate with
staff.  The Store Manager checks whether staff read “important” messages and
certainly the Store Clerk understood management monitored if staff are reading
messages.
[
127
]
Keeping hard copies of the incident binder and of the Terms and
Conditions Handbook easily available for staff to refresh themselves on the
identification requirements and the prohibition on sales to minors is a good
way to reinforce the employees’ training.
[
128
]
The notation at the till of the date of birth to legally purchase
cannabis can be helpful in assisting the sales clerks in assessing if the
identification presented is sufficient, but a point of sale prompt that
requires a sales clerk to acknowledge they have actually asked for
identification (or have assessed if there is a need to ask for identification)
can be a good addition to prevent the sale to a minor.  Follow up reports on
the use of the prompt could also be helpful in ensuring that the prompt is
being properly used by each sales clerk.
[
129
]
I have considered the signage in place at the time of the contravention
and find it to be adequate and commend the Licensee for the additional signage
added after the contravention but have not considered that as evidence of due
diligence, given the timing of it.
[
130
]
I also considered if the Licensee’s inconsistent direction with respect
to the age to request identification (under 40, under 30 and/or under 25) might
possibly have confused its employees, but I did not find the Sales Clerk to be
confused about this at all and so find that this slight discrepancy was not
problematic.  However, I recommend the Licensee confirm its policy in this
regard and ensure that all employees are aware of what the policy is.
[
131
]
While the Licensee’s informal “testing” of employees by friends does not
meet the higher standard of a secret shopper program, the evidence of both the
Store Manager and the Sales Clerk is they were well aware of the MAP program,
the possibility they might be covertly inspected, and the need to take
appropriate actions (that is, to request identification).
[
132
]
I find that the Licensee’s strict policy of terminating any staff who sell
cannabis products to minors, which was promptly applied with respect to the sale
to the Minor Agent, is a very good message to staff about the seriousness of their
responsibility to request identification.
[
133
]
While I have indicated the Licensee could undertake additional steps to ensure
its training program is more effectively applied, on a balance of probabilities
and applying a standard of reasonableness and not perfection, I find the
Licensee’s systems in place to be adequate.
CONCLUSION
[
134
]
I find the Licensee places a high value on compliance and makes a strong
effort to both ensure its staff are well-trained in their responsibility of not
selling cannabis to minors and to put in place systems to reinforce that
training.
[
135
]
I therefore find that the Licensee has satisfied the onus on it to
establish the defence of due diligence and therefore has a defence to the
contravention of
section 69(1)
of the
Act
.
